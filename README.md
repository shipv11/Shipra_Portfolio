My data analytics projects 

# [Excel Project - Bike Sales Analysis](https://github.com/shipv11/ExcelProject_BikeSales)
In this Excel project we analyse Bike sales data. Firstly, we make some additional helper columns in the working sheet. Then we make use of Pivot tables and Pivot charts to analyse average income of customers, age and age group, and commute distance. Lastly we put it all together in a presentable dashboard and join it with various slicers.
(Note: Please enable editing in Excel to make use of slicers.)

# [Tableau Project - Sample Superstore](https://github.com/shipv11/TableauProject_SampleSuperstore)
In this Tableau Project, we analyse Sample Superstore dataset. We make use of some basic charts like Pie chart, Bar chart, Heat table, Highlight table, Map, and several advanced charts such as Dual axis chart, Blended axis chart, Lollipop chart, Donut chart and Funnel chart. We also use Calculated fields, Filters, Ranking and Forecasting.
(Note: In order to open the .twbx file, you need access to Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader.)

# [SQL Project - Window Functions](https://github.com/shipv11/SQLProject_WindowFunctions)
In this SQL project we use window functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), NTILE(), and LAST_VALUE() to manipulate data in the project-db database. We also use aggregate window functions together with the OVER() clause to query this database.

# [Excel Project - Call Centre Analysis](https://github.com/shipv11/ExcelProject_CallCentreAnalysis)
In this Excel Project, we analyse Call centre data. We prepare the data for dashboarding by doing the needed calculations in the Calcs sheet. We then pull through a few calculations on the dashboard sheet just to make things easier. We then make our dashboard using conditional formatting, sparklines, gauge chart, doughnut chart, data validation, and scroll bar.
