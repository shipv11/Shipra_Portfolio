# [Audible Review - Python and Tableau](https://github.com/shipv11/Audible_Review-Python_and_Tableau)
This dataset has information about the books on audible, their authors and narrators, their language, their length, their release date, the price, and the ratings given by readers. I cleaned the data in python by extracting numbers from strings using regex, changing datatypes of columns to show proper values, and cleaning and standardising string values. Then I loaded the cleaned csv in Tableau. After analysing the data, I created a dashboard that displayed the most rated authors, their ratings, the number of books written by them, and the average price and length of these books.

# [SQL Project - Data Cleaning](https://github.com/shipv11/DataCleaningInSQL)
This dataset is about companies around the world that laid off employees from 2020-2023. I cleaned the dataset by deleting duplicates, trimming strings, standardising spellings, populating empty values, and deleting unwanted rows and columns.

# [Excel Project - Call Centre Analysis](https://github.com/shipv11/ExcelProject_CallCentreAnalysis)
In this project I produced a dashboard reviewing the performance of a Call Centre during the past six months. I prepared the data for visualization by performing the needed calculations in the Calcs sheet. I then pull through a few calculations on the dashboard sheet just to make things easier. I then prepared the dashboard using conditional formatting, sparklines, gauge chart, doughnut chart and data validation.

# [Power BI Project - Hospital waiting list](https://github.com/shipv11/PowerBIproject-HospitalWaitingList)
The data is a publicly available dataset from Ireland about the waiting list of patients requiring treatment from a few hospitals between 2018 and 2021. In this project I made a dashboard tracking the current status of the patient waiting list, analysing the  historical monthly trend of waiting list in Inpatient and Outpatient categories and made a detailed page displaying speciality and age profile analysis.
